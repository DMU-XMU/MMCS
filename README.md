# MMCS

This is a pytorch implementation of MMCS on [Challenges and Opportunities in Offline Reinforcement Learning from Visual Observations](https://github.com/conglu1997/v-d4rl) (V-D4RL).

## Requirements

For applying MMCS on visual-d4rl, one can follow the requirements from [official repo of v-d4rl](https://github.com/conglu1997/v-d4rl).

## Dependencies

* run the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` and install all the required packages.

## Training

You can refer to the example script file `run_mmcs.sh` to use MMCS for representation learning.
